# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI

My third pet-project

Tic-Tac-Toe with optional multi-level AI.

Commands:

exit - end the game

start [user|easy|medium|hard] [user|easy|medium|hard] - start the game, 
where user - non-AI player; easy, medium, hard - AI player.

Easy - the computer plays randomly.

Medium - the computer plays randomly, but if it can win on the next move, it makes a winning move.

Hard - the computer uses minimax algorithm.
